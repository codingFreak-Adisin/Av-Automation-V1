This project is an Arduino powered RFID sensor door lock. This projects uses two led's, some jumper wires, one Arduino Uno, RFID card, RFID tag, RFID sensor, one Servo motors and two resistors. This projects uses the RFID sensors to read the RFID card, the card number which is provided in the code, using that it allows the servo motor to rotate which opens the lock. If someone uses a RFID card or tag which does not have authorized access to the sensor, it will make the red led blink two times.  If they use the correct RFID card, which has the authorized access. The blue Led blinks 2 times and then the servo motors rotate.
